# Project Proposal: Tennis Game (Title TBD)

Our project is a top-down 2D pixel art 1v1 tennis game (working title TBD), drawing heavy inspiration from classics like Super Tennis and Mario Tennis. As a team of passionate tennis players, we aim to translate our love for the sport into a fast-paced, competitive digital experience. 

The game features a custom ball physics system. We aim for a balance between realistic collisions and engaging arcade gameplay, making the controls intuitive yet challenging. This core engine supports both local multiplayer and single-player modes against AI. To elevate the experience beyond a standard sports simulation, we are implementing a unique skill system and dynamic environments to ensure high replayability. Each character comes with unique abilities. These range from authentic techniques like power smashes to "fantasy" skills, such as shrinking the ball to disadvantage the opponent.

Furthermore, each map introduces specific environmental hazards, such as freezing mechanics in the Antarctica stage or sandstorms in the desert, that force players to adapt their strategy. Our goal is to ensure that no two matches feel the same, providing a consistently fresh and unpredictable experience for the players.
